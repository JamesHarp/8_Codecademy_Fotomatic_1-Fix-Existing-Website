# Fotomatic
Fotomatic is [Project #8](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-web-development-foundations/tracks/fscj-22-making-a-website-responsive/modules/wdcp-22-learn-css-documentation-and-debugging-679e7a04-ff8b-4693-a364-fa420794d1be/informationals/f1-2-c1p1-fotomatic) in the Codecademy [Full Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer).  The aim of the project is to correct the mistakes in the sample project to match the specification.  For practice, I am budling the project from scratch to match the specification after first fixing and then rebuilding the broken site.
